# epicea

Epicea is a tool for Pharo that records **code changes** enriched with **IDE events**. 

Epicea extends and could replace the traditional **.changes** logging mechanism, where the recorded code changes are incomplete and are not properly reified and thus it can be difficult to recover lost code after an image crash.

Epicea has a small subproject, named **Ombu**, which provides simple persistence. By default, Ombu uses [STON](http://smalltalkhub.com/#!/~SvenVanCaekenberghe/STON) to write the events when they are announced in the system. STON is part of Pharo 5.0.

**Brief history**

This project started as a fork (or a continuation) of Ezequiel's [NewChangeSystem](http://smalltalkhub.com/#!/~EzequielLamonica/NewChangeSystem). It got inspiration as well in GÃ¶ran's [DeltaStreams](http://wiki.squeak.org/squeak/6001).
